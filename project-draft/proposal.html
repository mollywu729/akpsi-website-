      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        Alpha Kappa Psi (AKPsi for short) is a professional business fraternity at the University of Washington (UW).
        It currently has 88 active members and is the largest professional fraternity on campus, its recruitment process attracting well over 
        300 students a year; however, AKPsi is often an organization that many people discover via word of mouth. Information about the organization 
        is not easily accessible and the process tends to favor those who are already familiar with or know someone within the organization. 
        Thus, the recruitment process is often injected with bias a prevents a truly equitable recruitment process. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The information technology problem Alpha Kappa Psi currently faces is not having an efficient and well-maintained website for members and other 
        students to utilize. Due to the absence of this data organization application, members have to rely on other forms of communication, such as email 
        and Facebook groups, to receive information about upcoming events and to-do items. For students interested in joining Alpha Kappa Psi, it is difficult 
        for them to research more about the organization and connect with current members.
      </p>

      <p>
        Previously, the Alpha Kappa Psi UW had an website in the past, however, there are a few issues with it. First of all, the website is hosted on wix 
        using a template, therefore, oftentimes, members or people who are interested in learning about the organization found it difficult to navigate the page. 
        There are issues such as pages doesn’t refresh or certain buttons don’t have function. Secondly, the member information was outdated. You oftentimes 
        found members who have graduated 3 years ago and the leadership didn’t get updated since 2018. Lastly, the website design has a lot of flaws. 
        For example, the color was not organization approved or there is no info page for people who are interested in joining.

      <h3>Proposed Application</h3>
      <p>
        For this application, we have two primary user groups: current organization members and those interested in becoming members. We plan to incorporate features 
        that can benefit both groups and be utilized by them as well. The users will be viewing information like member list, upcoming events, organization description 
        and values, member resources, as well as social media links to keep up with what’s happening in the organization. This helps to make all current and relevant 
        information easily accessible to current and potential members.
      </p>

      </p>

      <p>
        There are generally two different types of users for the app. 
        <ul> 
          <li>
          First is for current members and the other one is for people who are interested in joining the 
          organization. For people who are current active members, one feature provided in this app is that users can input their own information to the database. This 
          solves the problem of having updated member information because members can edit it easily themselves. Another feather provided for members is that they can log 
          in as members and it will take them to the member-only specific page. There will be chapter information as well as member-only resources available. 
          </li>
          <li>
          For people who are interested in learning about the organization but not current members, they can browse through the member information and filter members by their majors 
          and pledge class. It makes it easier for people to connect with members.
          </li>
        </ul> 
      </p>

      <p>
        This app will provide a central location that elucidates information about AKPsi; it will be a platform that anyone can easily access and navigate. By providing 
        information and data that you would otherwise be unable to attain without knowing someone in the organization, this app will create a more equitable recruitment 
        process. AKPsi is also an organization that often fails to reach underrepresented groups; this application will enable us to not only provide a more equitable 
        recruitment process, it will further a greater goal to diversify and champion equitable recruitment in a professional setting.
